## Assignments
Attached are several past assignments representing the kind of work I have done with python.    

The final project for my Statistics 138 class analyzes data on the diagnosis of depression in primary care and how well it works based on factors of the patient (i.e. age, physical condition, mental condition).    
The take home final attempts to fit a model for the relationship between two throat surgery methods and which one is more successful. 

The takehome midterm goes over several problems and attempts to fit models for several cases: ejections from car crashes and the severity of injuries, presence of kyphosis in infants, and, my favorite one, the number of assissts Rajon Rondo had in his season and the probability of winning the basketball game.
